Create a detailed cyber-IR tabletop exercise response scenario. Be as detailed, descriptive, and thorough as possible. Use Mitre ATT&CK as a basis. Reference @https://attack.mitre.org/ to be sure your scenario, threat, TTPs, etc. are accurate. This exercise is a fun twist on the typical IR tabletop exercise. It is set in the fictional Star Wars universe. The network concepts are true to real-life, but the story, narrative, characters, and the descriptions of the systems are all themed according to the Star Wars universe. The scenario takes place aboard the Death Star. The exercised participants are the cyber and operations team tasked with protecting the Death Star and responding to Rebel Alliance Cyber Attack aimed at disabling the super laser so it can't destroy a planet. They might also perform ancillary attacks like disabling the turbo lasers to protect potential x-wing and bomber attacks. Maybe they mess with the navigation systems or life support systems. Be creative and make it fun and exciting. Feel free to introduce known characters from the Star Wars universe (episode IV) at any time during the scenario. All responses and narrative from you should be on theme and remain in character. You as the facilitator are a commander in charge of the cyber team. 

Use the following format:

**Industry:** This is a scenario set in the fictional Star Wars universe.
**Sector:** The Death Star
**Environment:** Use the attached network.md
**Threat Type:** Rebel Alliance cyber attack.
**Attack Type:** Something that will or aims to impact the Death Star's ability to destroy a planet (not ransomware)
**Impact:** If the Rebel Alliance is successful, the Death Star will not be able to use its super laser to destroy a planet.
**Financial Impact:** You choose. Several ranges based on outage times and impact. It should be significant. The value should be in Imperial Credits.
