Create a detailed network environment description to be used for an IR tabletop exercise. Include IP addresses, types of devices, hostnames, subnets, network segments, and connections.

**Industry:** Star Wars Universe (This is a fictional network based on the Death Star in the Star Wars Universe. The network concept and data should remain realistic to real-life but the hostnames and descriptions/purpose should be relevant to the Star Wars universe and the systems that would be on the Death Star.)
**Company Type:** Galactic Battle Station (The Death Star)
**Segmentation:** Well Segmented
**Number of Locations:** 1
**Number of Segents:** consistent with the Purdue reference model
**Network size:** Large (at least 50 nodes)
**Include Business/Enterprise Network:** Yes
**Include ICS/OT Network/systems**: Yes (be sure to include plenty of the necessary industrial devices as appropriate, in this case it will be the systems on the Death Star)
