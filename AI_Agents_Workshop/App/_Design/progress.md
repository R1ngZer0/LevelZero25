     - [x] Implement an LLM client (API or local model) that receives a single interview payload and returns a summary and detailed analysis.  
     - [x] Parse and validate the LLM's response using Pydantic to ensure consistent structure.  
   - **Cross-Section Analysis Agent**  
     - [x] Implement an LLM client that can handle bulk data or a summarized dataset of multiple interviews.  
     - [x] Produce aggregated insights (e.g., common tools, recurring safety issues).  

2. **Prompt Engineering**  
   - [x] Design and refine prompts for both individual and cross-sectional analyses.  
   - [ ] Test with sample interviews to ensure coherent and useful LLM responses.

3. **Integration with Coordinator**  
   - [x] Ensure the coordinator agent handles the full data flow:  
     1. Request from front-end →  
     2. Data retrieval from DB →  
     3. Forwarding to LLM agent →  
     4. Receiving results →  
     5. Writing results back to DB.

4. **Error Handling & Monitoring**  
   - [x] Implement retries or fallback logic if the LLM times out or returns incomplete data.
