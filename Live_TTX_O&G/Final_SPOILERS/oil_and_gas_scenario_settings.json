  "threatScenario": "Covert Hydrocarbon Interference\n\n⸻\n\nDescription\n\nThis tabletop exercise focuses on a sophisticated threat actor targeting the midstream and downstream operations of an oil & gas company. The attacker has identified critical gaps within corporate-IT to ICS/OT network segmentation and aims to sabotage fuel supply. In this scenario, they exploit a third-party vendor management system, pivot into the corporate network, and eventually manipulate critical ICS controllers tied to pipeline flow and refinery processes.\n\nParticipants will practice incident response (IR) procedures, assess corporate-to-OT network segmentation, ensure operational continuity, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and coordinate with external partners such as local law enforcement, industry peers, and regulators.\n\n⸻\n\nThreat\n\nBackstory\n\nAn advanced persistent threat group, previously linked to attacks against critical infrastructure in other regions, has turned its sights on the organization. Over the last few months, threat intelligence sources have observed reconnaissance activities against oil & gas companies worldwide. The group's hallmark is stealthy infiltration and sabotage of equipment that can cause either partial or complete disruption without drawing immediate attention.\n\nIndustry/Technology Focus\n\t•\tMidstream: Pipeline SCADA systems, networked PLCs, pressure and flow controllers, remote terminal units (RTUs), and system management for distribution.\n\t•\tDownstream: Refinery ICS/OT environment including control loops for hydrocarbon processing, blending, and refining.\n\t•\tCorporate IT: ERP, HR, email, vendor management portals, data analytics platforms, and remote access solutions.\n\nMotivation\n\t•\tGeopolitical Leverage: Disruption to oil & gas operations can impact local fuel supply chains, potentially increasing energy prices and creating leverage for nation-state or criminal negotiations.\n\t•\tIntellectual Property Theft: Secondary motive to exfiltrate proprietary refinery process data to assist the threat actor's domestic energy development.\n\t•\tSabotage/Disruption: A primary end goal is to cause physical and economic harm, damaging critical infrastructure and the organization's reputation.\n\nPreferred Attacks, Technology, and Exploits\n\t•\tSpearphishing & Social Engineering: Precise targeting of vendors and key personnel.\n\t•\tExploitation of Public-Facing Applications (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1190): Targeting vulnerable vendor portal or corporate web applications.\n\t•\tValid Accounts (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1078): Leveraging stolen credentials to gain privileged access.\n\t•\tAbuse of Remote Services (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1133): Exploiting misconfigured RDP/VPN/SSH paths between corporate and OT environments.\n\t•\tCommand and Scripting Interpreter (MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1059): Using PowerShell or custom malware implants to maintain stealth.\n\t•\tExecution of Malicious ICS Payloads: Targeting PLC logic, SCADA configurations, or historian manipulation to disrupt physical processes.\n\n⸻\n\nScenario\n\nAttacker Objectives\n\t1.\tStealthy Entry: Establish initial foothold inside the corporate network, gather intel on ICS environment, collect valid credentials, and move laterally.\n\t2.\tPivot to ICS: Access the refinery's control system and pipeline SCADA network, manipulate critical flow and pressure setpoints, potentially causing safety system triggers or forced shutdown.\n\t3.\tDisruption of Operations: Sabotage refining processes (e.g., catalytic cracking units, distillation columns) and force pipeline operational shutdowns, causing massive revenue loss and supply chain disruption.\n\t4.\tCover Tracks: Deploy \"cleanup\" scripts and obscure logs to complicate investigation and forensics.\n\nInitial Attack Vector\n\t•\tCompromised Vendor Portal: The threat actor exploits an unpatched vulnerability (CVE is plausible, but not specified in the exercise) in the third-party vendor management system used for contract and maintenance work. This application is internet-facing and used by legitimate vendors to schedule on-site pipeline inspections and refinery maintenance tasks.\n\t•\tCredential Harvesting: After gaining initial access, the attacker harvests valid accounts from the vendor portal database, including those belonging to internal employees who have single sign-on privileges.\n\nSuggested Mitre ATT&CK TTP Chain\n\nBelow is a high-level chain referencing Enterprise-focused Tactics, though in reality, ICS-specific Tactics (from ATT&CK for ICS) may overlap:\n\t1.\tReconnaissance\n\t•\tT1592: Gather Victim Host Information (Scanning publicly available IT/OT infrastructure details)\n\t•\tT1598: Phishing for Information (targeting employees/vendors)\n\t2.\tResource Development\n\t•\tT1587.001: Develop Capabilities: Malware (custom RAT or ICS-tailored malware)\n\t3.\tInitial Access\n\t•\tT1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application (Vendor management portal)\n\t•\tT1078: Valid Accounts (stolen vendor credentials)\n\t4.\tExecution\n\t•\tT1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter (PowerShell, Python, or custom ICS-specific payloads)\n\t5.\tPersistence\n\t•\tT1547: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (Registry run keys, scheduled tasks in the IT environment)\n\t6.\tPrivilege Escalation\n\t•\tT1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (using known OS kernel or local service vulnerabilities)\n\t7.\tDefense Evasion\n\t•\tT1070: Indicator Removal on Host (clearing logs to hide ICS manipulations)\n\t8.\tCredential Access\n\t•\tT1003: OS Credential Dumping (harvesting domain admin or ICS engineer credentials)\n\t9.\tDiscovery\n\t•\tT1046: Network Service Scanning (mapping ICS devices, PLCs, and SCADA servers)\n\t10.\tLateral Movement\n\t•\tT1021: Remote Services (RDP/SSH to pivot between IT and OT segments)\n\t11.\tCollection\n\t•\tT1119: Automated Collection (scripts to gather ICS configs, PLC logic files)\n\t12.\tCommand and Control\n\t•\tT1095: Non-Application Layer Protocol (custom ICS protocol tunnels or encryption to hide traffic)\n\t13.\tInhibit Response Function (ICS disruption)\n\t•\tT831 (ICS-specific example – manipulate protective control parameters, e.g., turning off safety checks)\n\t14.\tImpact\n\t•\tT1489: Service Stop (stopping ICS data historian or SCADA services)\n\t•\tT1496: Resource Hijacking (overloading ICS CPU resources, forcibly shutting down pipeline pumps)\n\nAdditional Notes, Caveats, Details\n\t•\tSafety Instrumented Systems (SIS): If the attacker manipulates setpoints that cause frequent SIS trips or spurious shutdown, critical processes may go offline.\n\t•\tRegulatory Compliance: Potential compliance ramifications with agencies overseeing pipeline safety and environmental regulations.\n\t•\tSupply Chain Partners: Refining and distribution partners may also be affected if pipeline flow is halted, leading to possible legal claims.\n\t•\tData vs. Control Manipulation: Attackers may conduct false data injection to hide sabotage attempts from monitoring operators, further delaying detection.\n\n⸻\n\nRecommended Injects\n\t1.\tUnusual Vendor Login Alert\n\t•\tTimestamped logs indicate a vendor user account accessing the portal from a foreign IP address at 3:00 AM local time.\n\t•\tThe session triggers a high-volume data download from the portal, specifically ICS site schematics.\n\t2.\tSuspicious IT Ticket\n\t•\tHelp Desk receives multiple complaints from employees about forced logouts and password resets.\n\t•\tSecurity teams detect unexplained elevated privileges for a recently added vendor account.\n\t3.\tSCADA Alarms & Automatic Shutdown\n\t•\tOperators in the pipeline control room report repeated pressure fluctuations.\n\t•\tA major pipeline loop segment shows forced valve closures in the ICS operator interface.\n\t•\tSIS triggers a partial shutdown, claiming \"High Pressure Anomaly\" in one segment.\n\t4.\tRefinery Control System Glitch\n\t•\tRefinery unit operators notice setpoints on distillation columns and catalytic cracking units automatically reset to dangerously high or low thresholds.\n\t•\tCommunication from the data historian server becomes erratic; the server reboots unexpectedly multiple times.\n\t5.\tExternal Inquiry from Regulator/Partner\n\t•\tThe local energy regulatory body requests an urgent meeting due to intelligence of a credible threat targeting national pipeline systems.\n\t•\tA shipping partner complains that scheduled deliveries are delayed, citing unresponsive pipeline scheduling systems.\n\t6.\tThreat Actor Statement or Discovery\n\t•\tA short message or banner left on a compromised engineering workstation, stating that the facility is under \"external control.\"\n\t•\tThe security team recovers partial code fragments of ICS-specific malware from the DMZ logs, indicating a stealthy infiltration tailored for sabotage.\n\t7.\tEmergency Response Escalation\n\t•\tThe Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is informed that production must halt in certain units to investigate abnormal ICS commands.\n\t•\tSenior leadership calls for crisis management procedures, prompting cross-functional teams (legal, PR, operations, safety, IT, HR) to assemble.\n\t8.\tFinancial Impact Projections\n\t•\tCFO's office demands immediate financial impact analysis for the downtime, referencing potential breach-of-contract penalties from commercial customers.\n\t•\tStock price begins to drop as rumors of a major cyber event circulate.\n\t9.\tForensic and IR Findings\n\t•\tPreliminary forensics reveal malicious scripts that correlate with known APT TTPs.\n\t•\tMalware includes modules specifically designed to interact with common ICS protocols (Modbus/TCP or OPC variants).",
